Nearly 2 years of hands-on experience across AI research and production, with roles at Mercor, Curify-AI, Webomates, and ResoluteAI. I’ve built and deployed real-world ML systems spanning medical AI, computer vision, NLP, and large-scale benchmarks.

Co-founded Feedhire, an AI-powered global job discovery platform using NLP and open-source LLMs, scaled to 1,000+ users across multiple countries.

Strong in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud-based ML, with a research-first mindset and experience building production systems.

While I enjoy AI broadly, my primary interests lie in Research AI and Medical AI, where I aim to create meaningful, high-impact solutions.`,
